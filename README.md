Algorithm-Experiment
====================

##Introduction
Algorithm experiment code written by Swift  
This is a worksapce built on target OSX 10.10. It contains several projects:  
- ConvexHull
- LCS

##Environment
OSX Yosemite  
##Projects
###ConvexHull
I solve this issue with three methods: BruteForce(O(n^4)), GrahamScan(O(nlogn)) and Divide&Conquer(O(nlogn)). 
###LCS
Longest Common Sequence.  
Divide&Conquer  
Dynamic Programming
